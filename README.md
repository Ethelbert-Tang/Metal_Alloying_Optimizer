# Metal Alloying Optimizer

This is my take on an optimization program to calculate approximate alloy usage to create a certain grade of a metal. The example uses are randomly selected and configured grades (Metal_Grades.csv) of steel and the selected alloying additions (Metal_Weight_Per_ton.csv) are found in general steelmaking use.

# Usage

- Set up steel grades and configurations in the Metal_Grades.csv file

- Set up the alloying additions, the respective compositions, in the Metal_Weight_Per_ton.csv file

- Run code and select grade in the pop-up window to calculate.
