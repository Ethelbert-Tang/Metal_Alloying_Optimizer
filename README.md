This is a optimization program to calculate approximate alloy usage to create a certain grade of a metal. The example used are randomly selected and configured grades of steel and the selected alloying additions are all general steelmaking use.

# Usage

- Set up steel grades and configurations in the Metal_Grades.csv file

- Set up the alloying additions, the respective compositions, in the Metal_Weight_Per_ton.csv file

- Run code and select grade to calculate
